Our preprocessing aims to speed up our routine analysis, which gives us and our server more time to develop new analysis.

Every month, we receive an extract of MHSDS data for the most recent month from NHS Digital. This contains all data submitted during the most recent submission window:
  primary data (FileType 1)
  performance data (FileType 2)
  data resubmitted under multiple submission model (MSM, FileType >2)

NHS England typically receive this data a week or two before the publication of official statistics by NHS Digital so this extract is consumed into our 'PrePublication' database, where access is limited to a few people. 

The PrePublication database contains the latest extract of data

Once the official statistics are released by NHS Digital, the data in the PrePublication database is transferred into our main store of MHSDS data.

Our preprocessing makes the most of the time between the data hitting the PrePublication database and the subsequent release of official statistics, so is based on the data in the latest extract

We appreciate that this adds a layer of complexity to our analysis, but by making our preprocessing code available we hope this improves the transparency of our work. If you have any comments or questions please contact us at england.mhanalytics@nhs.net
